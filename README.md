# Project1-SetlistOrganizer

The Setlist Organizer consists of:

1 - A list of "jam sessions" and associated songs (the "setlist").  Also a name and date for the jam session.  This information is stored in LocalStorage.

2 - A master song list so that once a song is added to a setlist, it is thereafter available via a dropdown to add to other setlists.  Also stored in LocalStorage

3 - A LyricsWiki interface that can be used either in standalone fashion, or by simply clicking on a song in a setlist
